# MyWorkout API

## About
MyWorkout is a PWA (Progressive Web App) allowing its users to launch workout sessions.

Uses:
- Laravel 5.8
- JWT Auth (https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth)
- Lighthouse (GraphQL server for Laravel : https://lighthouse-php.com/)
- MongoDB (soon...)

TODO:
- Advance GraphQL server setup (already allows JWT login, and some basic ORM operations thanks to Lighthouse)
- Setup a MongoDB server for storing user performance results.
- Setup unit testing.
